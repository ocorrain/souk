  - bundles are sets of products (qlists)
  - the bundle interface allows the bundle to be defined
  - a picking interface (similar to the single items list) that allows
    single items and quantities to be added to the bundle
  - this picking interface to be broken down by category for ease
  - photographs can be associated with bundles: if none are, the
    bundle photographs will be the set of photos of the single items
    in the bundles
  - bundles can contain other bundles, but may not contain themselves

* TODO Facility for stock-keeping

  - Max number of items of one type that can be sold per week
  - can be changed manually
  - once that number has been exceeded, customers are offered a
    waiting list for an overcapacity of 50%
  - once that's been exceeded, the item disappears from the site until
    the following week, with the quota reduced by the number of items
    that are on the waiting list.  This is to stop quota snowballing

* TODO Variable distribution

  - some items can't be distributed all over the world, due to
    packaging and perishability
  - each item needs to have an additional field describing its
    distributability: suggestions
    - Ireland only
    - Europe only
    - Ireland, Europe, and USA only
    - Rest of the world
  - the distribuability of a bundle is that of the least distributable
    of its elements

  - when an shopping cart has been processed it becomes an order
  - an order is a paid commitment to a customer to deliver goods
  - an order being placed triggers the following
    - a mail being sent to the customer with an order number saying
      that an order has been placed and paid
    - a mail being sent to the vendor with the order number, a list of
      goods in the order, and the order price
    - an order object being created from the shopping cart.
  - a list of outstanding (and fulfilled) orders needs to be in the
    system, so vendors can check off fulfilled orders a view what is
    in the outgoing queue
